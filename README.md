  ## Description: 
  Organic foods open marketplace. Private sellers can sell farmer's market type goods in an ebay like marketplace. Users of the site can create an account, which functions as both a buying and selling account. The homepage displays products for sale by category and a list of the user's watched products at the top. User's can watch and unwatch products with a click of a button. The user can also login to view their profile page. 

  ## Notes:
  This project was originally a collaborative project. Please see link for original project repo. https://github.com/zmuda44/Traders-Johns-E-commerce-site-group-project

  Please note my contributions to the original project in both front-end and back-end. I have taken the original collaborative project and greatly improved functionality, added new features and restyled the website.

  ## Improvements:
  The list below are improvements done by me from the original collaborative project
  - Original project was done using Handlebars. I switched over to a React frontend.
  - Restyled homepage to list all items by category in sections. When a category is chosen, the chosen category row updates accordingly.
  - Added watched items functionality and ability to watch and unwatch products. This involved more complicated queries with include models through other models.
  - Added functionality to query popular items based on number of watches and display on homepage and profile page.
  - Added User sold items to profile page and a seller dashboard which will allow the User to edit and delete their items listed for sale.

  ## Upcoming:  
  The individual product page will have checkout options
